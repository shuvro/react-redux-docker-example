## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artsmorgan/KYC_Cathay.git
cd KYC_Cathay
yarn
```
#
## Get started / Development

```bash
yarn start
```
#
## For Production
First we need to build the project. Then serve with any production process manager like: forver or pm2.
##
Serve with `forever`. Prerequisite library [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) and [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever)

```bash
yarn build
forever start -c "serve -s" ./build
# to specefy port
forever start -c "serve -s -l 5500" ./build
```
The application should run `5000` port or specefied port.

This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.
